<p>The FEU Institute of Technology Association for Computing Machinery
Student Chapter launched R15E: A Computer Science Convention, a weeklong
event that spanned from June 27 to July 2 in celebration of the said
organization’s 15th year since its inception.</p>
<p>This year’s iteration is themed, “Forging Changemakers in the
Computing Field.” R15E, through the continuous hard work of its
volunteers. It sought to develop fledgling minds into world changers
through computing. Furthermore, this year’s symbol is a Crystal
gemstone, a common motif for 15th-year anniversaries; an enduring
reminder of the past and present ACM administrations, and their lasting
contributions to the ever-growing community of computer scientists in
the Far Eastern University.</p>
<p>With Krysch Chalia Atienza—FEU-TECH ACM’s current presiding
president—at the helm, the event aimed to promote and widen knowledge
about the field of computing among the youth, discuss the various fields
and applications that aspiring professionals can explore in their future
careers, and tackle relevant technologies and issues that Computer
Science students need to be aware of as they enter the industry. These,
and many more, were discussed and put into action through a series of
webinars, competitions, virtual booths, and panel discussions.</p>
<p>The event was held virtually through the video-sharing application
Zoom, pursuant to the COVID-19 guidelines imposed on the country as a
whole. Nevertheless, events were plenty and prizes were likewise
bountiful.</p>
<p>The first day of the event, subtitled Define, was a series of talks
discussing modern technologies led by speakers from various fields of
expertise. Mr. Jambert De Guzman of Fujitsu Philippines GDC, the keynote
speaker, kicked off the session by enlightening the participants on what
is currently abuzz in the field of computing. He was then followed by
Mr. Michael Baloran of EY Global Delivery Services, Ms. Farah Dela Cruz
of Fujitsu Philippines GDC, and Mr. John Mark Fernandez of The Infinite
Machine Collection, who gave the participants an overview of SAP, Cloud
Computing, and Tokenomics (Blockchain Technology), respectively.</p>
<p>Decode, the second day of R15E, continued what Define set out to do —
promote the emerging breakthroughs in tech. The session opened with a
webinar focusing on big data and analytics by Principal Scientist of the
Qatar Computing Research Institute, Dr. Bernard J. Jansen. Afterward,
the Developer Evangelist of Twilio, Mr. Kok Koon Gan, graced the screens
with his talk on application programming interfaces, or APIs. The
participants were then immersed in a talk on how to be ready for one’s
IT interview by Mr. Franz Gerardo of Collabera Philippines. Finally, two
parallel workshops that aimed to further nurture the coding skills of
the participants, particularly in the field of mobile programming:
Android and iOS delivered by Fujitsu Philippines GDC’s very own, Ms.
Carla Berdin and Mr. Adrian Tabay, capped off Decode. The workshop
facilitators with years of experience in the field talked about the
fundamentals of mobile programming, tips and tricks, and pointers on how
to break into the field.</p>
<p>The breadth of knowledge of voluntary participants from various
universities across the country was also tested on Day 3, Defy, wherein
they were pitted against each other in a quiz bee competition centering
around CS/IT concepts. On the other hand, wit, cunning, and team synergy
were the only tools of participating teams in Decrypt, R15E’s Day 4
event, which was the 3rd iteration of the Tech Trials: a high-pressure
virtual escape room competition. Participants in the said event partook
in a series of puzzles and brain teasers aimed to test their
out-of-the-box thinking under time pressure.</p>
<p>Day 5 saw a return to talks and webinars as ACM held Diverge, wherein
companies were invited to speak in virtual booths via Discord to discuss
the potential career paths of budding professionals in the field, as
well as a possible recruiting avenue for standouts in the morning. In
the afternoon, three resource speakers took to the virtual stage and
speak about other Computer Science branches: Mr. Sudeept Maharana of
Priceline tackled the rise of AI or artificial intelligence, Mr. Michael
Dugay explored the in-demand business technologies, and Dr. Rizwan Ahmed
delved into cybersecurity. Lastly, R15E ended on Deploy, which featured
a keynote message on unlocking one’s career in the Computer Science
industry by Ms. Jonah Baldero of Capgemini, and a talk by Mr. Patrick
Gonzales of Edukasyon.PH on personal branding and why it matters, and an
insightful and uplifting panel discussion with Mr. Aquib Ajani of
Unboxing Art, Ms. Kashish Sharma of DigiPod Tech, Mr. Leo Liro III of
IOT Technology, Incorporated, and Dr. Rik Das of Siemens Advanta
Consulting as panelists and Mr. Ricson Que of SQrity Consulting as
moderator, to cap off the weeklong celebration.</p>
<p>R15E would not have come to successful fruition without the help of
its GOLD SPONSORS: MSI Philippines, Fujitsu Philippines Global Delivery
Center (WeServ Systems International, Inc.), Ernst &amp; Young Global
Delivery Services Philippines, and Civicom Pacific. SILVER SPONSOR:
Union Bank of the Philippines, and BRONZE SPONSORS: Azeus Systems
Philippines Limited, Capgemini, Collabera, Pineda Cybersecurity, and
Edukasyon.PH. R15E’s media partners are BLB Live, Blog PH, Carthal
Manila, Diyaryo Milenyo - Digital News, Explained PH, Gadgets Magazine,
SparkUp, IKOT.PH, Twist TV, You.PH, Monster RX93.1, and
WhenInManila.com. The enduring partnership between FEU Tech ACM and
student organizations from different institutions in the Philippines
also helped make the event possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the recently concluded Annual Students’ Recognition
held last August 3, 2022, by FEU Institute of Technology which
recognized exemplary and exceptional performances of the institution’s
student organizations and their events, R15E was able to bag the
prestigious award: Best Organization Activity (Academic) for the entire
Academic Year 2021-2022, besting other FEU Tech recognized student
organization (RSO)’s events—a marvelous feat that serves as a great
exclamation point for the 6-day Computer Science Convention last June
27-July 2.</p>
<p>R15E was completely free of charge, and everyone from various walks
of life attended the 6-day convention. For further information about the

<p>More outstanding events like these are brewing on the horizon of FEU
Tech ACM as the new academic year 2022-2023 started last September. A
new roster of officers will bring forth both fun and substantial
activities that will surely cater to CS/IT students and non-CS/IT
students alike. Further inquiries should be directed towards the
